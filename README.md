This repository contains the code for an Azure Function App written in C# that serves as an API for retail store solutions. The API is designed to interact with Azure Cosmos DB and provides endpoints for managing products and items within the retail store.

## Features

- **Products Endpoint**: Allows you to create, retrieve, update, and delete product information.
- **Items Endpoint**: Provides functionalities for managing items associated with products.
- **Azure Cosmos DB Integration**: The API leverages Azure Cosmos DB as the backend database for seamless data storage and retrieval.
- **Scalable and Serverless**: Built using Azure Functions, the API is highly scalable and serverless, making it cost-effective and easy to manage.
